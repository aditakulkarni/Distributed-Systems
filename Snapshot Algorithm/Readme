1) How to compile and run code:

Steps:

bash
export PATH=/home/phao3/protobuf/bin/bin:$PATH
protoc --python_out=./ bank.proto

Run the branch file branch.sh as:
./branch.sh [branch_name] [port_no]

Running the controller file controller.sh as:
./controller.sh [amount] [branch_list_file]

2) Programming language used: Python

3) Description:

	Controller sends init_branch to all branches.
	The branches update their balance and sets up one tcp connection between all other branches.
	They keep on transferring random amount to each other at random intervals.
	Controller periodically calls initSnapshot on random branch and the branch sends the snapshot by executing the algorithm.

4) Sample Output:

./controller.sh 3000 branches.txt 

branches.txt:
branch1 128.226.180.163 9007
branch2 128.226.180.165 9008
branch3 128.226.180.164 9009

Output:

Snapshot ID: 1
branch1: 1060
branch2->branch1:0
branch3->branch1:0

Snapshot ID: 1
branch2: 980
branch1->branch2:0
branch3->branch2:0

Snapshot ID: 1
branch3: 960
branch1->branch3:0
branch2->branch3:0
